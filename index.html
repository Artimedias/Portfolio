    <hi>I'm Brett Roper, Welcome to my Portfolio</hi>

    <p>I look like this:</p>

    <p>About me:</p>
    <P>I'm 19, and I live on the in between from suburban and rural western Washington. I have both parents, and a younger sister who I care for very much. I'm not very good at writing about myself, so you'll have to forgive my akwardness here. I've lived a pretty easy life up to this point, as my father is very well off. That's not to say I never have had to work hard, the house we live in I spent every weekend and summer helping build throughout my middle school life. I was bullied a lot growing up, and that shows.</P>

    <h2>Why I got in coding</h2>
    <P>I got into coding when I was 11 years old, in 7th grade. My school had a video game design class, and it was by far the most fun I had ever had in a class up to this point. From that moment on I knew I wanted to design games for a living. Of course, I had thought about it before, as I grew up playing video games and making my own board games, but it always seemed like a bit of a pipe dream, something you just said to get adults off your back when they asked what you wanted to do when you grew up, like being an author, or a lawyer. But after that, it felt real. It felt attainable. Since then that dream has changed, as I realized I liked working with pretty much any code, not just video games, and learning about how terrible the video game industry could be. I still make games though, although my gamemaker days are long over, and I've since moved to unity and C#. But I know I can't just sit and make games for myself and a friend or two forever while I work at a pizza resturant for a living. I want more than that- which is why I went to college for a computer science degree. There, I failed. Despite how much I love coding, I hate math, and it was going to take me years of math classes before I could even take an intro to java course, something I knew I could already test out of. After failing pre-calc 2 three times in a row, I moved on. I was adrift for a while, until a friend of my dads suggested that I take a coding bootcamp, so I could get what I really needed to work as a software engineer without having to suffer through years of math. After months of searching, I settled on Epicodus. After spending most of what remained of my college savings, I'm now here, and so far it's been great.</P>

    <p>Projects I've Made:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Boring Project: A project where I used Lorem Ipsum and Divs to make a webpage that resembles a boring lecture</li>
        <li>Cupcake Project: A project where I used images, styles, and anchors to create a webpage for a fictional cupcake shop</li>
        <li>Places Project: A project where I used lists, links and images to show off some places I'd like to visit someday</li>
        <li>Webpage Project: A simple project where I just displayed a bunch of text in various forms as I made my first webpage in HTML</li>
        <li>Cookie Project: A very simple project that displays a cookie recipie, and an image of a cookie</li>
        <li>Hello Project: A classic hello world.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Projects I've Made <strong>Before</strong> Epicodus. As such, they have no github repository</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Lost Space Marine, Still in Space: A platform shooter where you control a space marine and fight your way across an alien planet to reach your ship</li>
        <li>CLC DiceRoller: A windows form with a lot of working parts. Served as a way to do battles in a board game I made with my friends once the rules got too complicated for humans to track</li>
        <li>Hank of the Dead: A video game I made with some friends at the Pierce County Skills Center. Has you playing as the titular Hank and fighting your way across a zombie infested City</li>
    </ol>
